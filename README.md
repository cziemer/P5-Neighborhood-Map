# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project - P5

Project Overview (as assigned): You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. 
You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

Since I live just outside Orlando, FL (Vacation Capitasl of the World), I decided to have my map show the most popular attractions in the area.

To load and use:

 * Save the files (index.html, js folder and css folder) locally in the same hierarchy
 * Open index.html in your favorite browser
 * You can click a marker on the map, or click a location in the list on the left to get additional information
 * Use the search function to narrow the list of attractions
 * Information about each place is courtesy of Foursquare
